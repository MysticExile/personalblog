        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome on my personal site! My name is Ethan Baboeram. I am 18 years old, and I was born and raised in The
            Netherlands.
            I made this site to log my projects and creations so please have a look around!
            <br>
            <br>
            Originally this site was meant to be a school project. I expanded on that project to make it a little more
            personal.
            <br>
            I am a creative being at heart who loves to sketch, hum and think of ideas. Most of them end up in the
            corner of my brain.
            But in the rare event I do go through with an idea, I like to make it grand.
            I mainly dabble in programming, electrical engineering, video content creation and music.
            Because of the major I do, I am often limited to programming. So in my free time I like to focus on the
            other aspects of my interests.
            But I feel like I have talked too much already, please have a look at my projects and creations!

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
        <h2>De scanstok</h2>
        My newest project was an assignment that I received in Q1 2022. <br>
        It was a team project that focused on making
        Zuidplein, a neighbourhood in Rotterdam, more accessible. <br>
        My team has made a site going into further detail
        which you can find <a href="https://kaasstengel28.github.io/sit-3/">here.</a>
        But beware this site is in Dutch.<br>
        In the video below you will see my team and me present our final product.<br>
        <br>
        <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tB3C-kNwjwA"
                title="YouTube video player"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

        <p>
        <h2>Benevolence</h2>
        To be very clear, I did NOT write this song. <br>I played the bass guitar, I edited the video, and I recorded
        some
        footage. <br>This song was written as an assignment for my friend's music course.<br>
        I'm sure he can provide a far more detailed explanation on the song.<br> When we got together and recorded the
        footage and instruments, I had the unique opportunity to record various segments of the video.<br>
        During the editing proces I managed to learn a lot about Adobe Premiere Pro and how often I like to curse at
        software.<br>
        Please enjoy!<br>
        <br>
        <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYh7gT3shxM" title="YouTube video player"

        <h2>Reservation system</h2>
        This project was an assignment that I received in Q4 2021.<br> It was a solo project where the goal was to
        develop a
        system where you can read, edit, delete and create reservations using an account and database.<br>
        This project was done in PHP. Unfortunately it isn't live, however I do have the source code to share with
        you.<br>
        You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/MysticExile/RSRVSTN_SYS">here</a> at the github repository.<br>
        I do have a screenshot of the create page which I would like to show you.
        <br>

        <br>
        During this project I learned a lot about CRUD functionality, security and commenting my code. <br>Overall I'd say
        this was a very fun project.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        While I haven't made many noteworthy projects, I did contribute to various projects.<br> My contribution to these
        projects are very minor so that's why I mention them here.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I have done very minor work on the Nintendo Switch emulator, <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu">yuzu</a>.
